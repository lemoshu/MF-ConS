## ðŸ§  Introduction

### ðŸ“„ Abstract

Achieving accurate 3D medical image segmentation typically requires dense voxel-level annotations, which are costly and time-consuming. To reduce annotation burden, we propose **MF-ConS**, a **Multi-Faceted Consistency Learning** framework designed for a new setting termed **Active Barely-Supervised Learning (Active BSL)**.

MF-ConS builds upon a teacher-student architecture and introduces a **cross-annotation strategy** where only three orthogonal slices (axial, sagittal, and coronal) per scan are labeled. To further optimize labeling efficiency, we integrate an **active learning module (DUS-AL)** that selects the most diverse and uncertain samples.

MF-ConS introduces three complementary consistency constraints:
- **Neighbor-Informed Object Prediction (NIOP)** for enhancing fine-grained contextual understanding,
- **Prototype-driven Consistency** for feature compactness and discriminativeness,
- **Stability Constraint** for robustness under perturbations.
